          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Currently I work with my dream employer, Sephora Canada as an associate Planner. Even though i've studied Finance and have considered studying for my CFA to go into investment banking i've found a career in Planning.
              <br>
                Noticing the growing trends towards Computer Sciences and Web Development i'm looking to expand my knowledge and be able to shift into the field.

          <p>With my 2 cousins i also have a small event/wedding decorating business called Almaari Decor. We've been incorporated for a year and are slowly but surely growing. This not only gives us a chance to do something creative while spending time together but has also taught us time-management and leadership skills.</p>
          <h3>Balancing Life</h3>
          <p>I did have a lot of hesitiation joining this bootcamp with ensuring I can balance work, my decor business, the gym and this class. However the more interested I am with the content of the program i'm even more sure that i'll be able to give 100% to this bootcamp.</p>

          <p>In University I focused in Finance and after graduating started studying for my CFA to go into investment banking. I found a job in accounting and soon realized i was no longer interested in finance/accounting.
              <br>s
              <p>I continued working in accounting while trying to decide what to pursue further. A few months ago i started a certificate program for Data Analytics and that's what got me interested in IT/Computer Sciences. During this time i've also started working at Sephora Canada in Planning which allows me to be creative and learn valuable business experience. However i am still looking forward to growing my expertise in an industry that's extremely fast growing and valuable. Someone introduced me to web developement and after learnign more about the job market/industry i'm extrenely excited to start this journey. </p>
